Goals, assists, and key passes.

Defensive contributions (tackles, interceptions, clearances).

Consistency and streaks, such as consecutive scoring or clean sheets.

Highlight impactful players (e.g., playmakers, goal scorers, or key defenders) who can influence outcomes.

4. Lineups and Squad Depth:

Review predicted or confirmed lineups, focusing on:

Injuries, suspensions, or rotation of key players.

Identify strengths and weaknesses, such as vulnerability to set-pieces or effectiveness on counterattacks.

6. Match Context and Stakes:

Consider the significance of the match, such as league title races, relegation battles, or knockout stages.

Assess team motivation levels, particularly in fixtures with uneven stakes.

Note pitch size and condition, as certain styles of play perform better in specific environments.

Average cards per match, penalties awarded, and foul rates.

How officiating styles may influence aggressive or defensive teams.
